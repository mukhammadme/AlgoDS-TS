## What's Big O Notation?

Big O Notation is a tool used to describe the time complexity of algorithms. It calculates the time taken to run an algorithm as the input grows. In other words, it calculates the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm. Big O Notation in Data Structure describes the upper bound of an algorithm's runtime.
